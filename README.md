JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Project | The Odin Project 

This is a simple JavaScript version of Rock, Paper; Scissors, playable in the browser console (tested with Chrome).
I used Math.floor and Math.random to generate the computer answer and implemented the results in the conditional statement. For loops werenâ€™t a requirement in the game project description yet, but I came back to the project after I completed the loop chapter and changed it. 

This was a fun project after I understood that the prompt needed to go into the loop, however with more training and knowledge, I eventually want to change it in a way that the prompt appears after each turn and then displays the result.
